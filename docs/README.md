# Geode

A Scheduling-Flexible, Powerful ECS

## Overview

There are four major components to Geode:

- **Component Storages**, which provide mechanisms for creating entities, attaching components to them, and accessing those components through either random access or querying.
- **Universes**, which provide mechanisms for automatically creating and accessing global state (e.g. storages and some archetypes), annotating archetypes with metadata, and scheduling tasks for execution with exclusive access to that global state.
- **Providers and Context Tuples**, which provide mechanisms for efficiently and ergonomically passing context from one function to the next, even if the context required by the function is determined dynamically.
- **Events**, which provide mechanisms for queueing up events on entities, defining debug-printable lazily-boxed function handlers, and scheduling function graphs with state dependencies for concurrent execution.

### Component Storages

**Archetypes** and **entities** are the building blocks of Geode applications.

An `Entity` is a 64 bit `Copy`'able identifier for some logical object. This could be a game object like a player or a zombie, or it could be something more abstract like a signal.

Every `Entity` is associated with *exactly one* `Archetype` and they will never change archetype throughout their lifetimes. Archetypes are collections of entities with the same set of components and entities within a given archetype are extremely efficient to iterate over.

There is no need for a `Universe` to begin using these objects. You can create the archetype like any other Rust container and spawn entities from it directly.

```rust
use geode::Archetype;

// Create an archetype with a debug label.
//
// The generic parameter is a marker type used to provide
// some level of type-safety in function signatures requesting
// an archetype of a certain kind. This type can be casted at will
// using the `cast_marker_xxx` methods.
let mut players = Archetype::<()>::new("players");

// Spawn an entity within that archetype.
//
// Once again, this method takes a debug label for the entity.
let my_player = players.spawn("my player");

// We'll also create an archetype for our zombies.
let mut zombies = Archetype::<()>::new("zombies");
let my_zombie = zombies.spawn("my zombie");
```

We can attach state to a given `Entity` using a `Storage`. Once again, these act like regular Rust containers:

```rust
use geode::Storage;

let mut positions = Storage::<[f32; 3]>::new();
let mut names = Storage::<String>::new();
let mut ai_goals = Storage::<Option<Entity>>::new();

// Different archetypes can have different sets of components.
positions.add(my_player, [0., 0., 0.]);
names.add(my_player, "The Player".to_string());

positions.add(my_zombie, [1., 2., 4.]);
ai_goals.add(my_zombie, Some(my_player));  // `Entity` is `Copy`
```

Storages expose a `HashMap`-like interface and allow for efficient random-access:

```rust
println!("Player {my_player:?} is at {:?}", positions[my_player]);

positions[my_player][1] = 3.;

if let Some(position) = positions.get(my_zombie) {
	println!("Zombie {my_zombie:?} has a position component.");
}
```

You can also iterate over the components of entities within a single archetype:

```rust
use geode::Query;

// You can query over storages one archetype at a time.
for (player, pos, name) in (&mut positions, &names).query_in(players.id()) {
	pos[1] -= 9.8;
	println!("{player:?} with name {name:?} has been updated.");
}

for (zombie, &ai_goal) in (&ai_goals,).query_in(zombies.id()) {
	if let Some(goal) = ai_goals {
		println!("{zombie:?} is chasing {goal:?} at {:?}", positions[goal]);
	}
}

let archetypes_needing_updating = vec![
	players.id(),  // `ArchetypeId` is also `Copy`.
	zombies.id(),
];

for &arch_id in &archetypes_needing_updating {
	for (target, pos) in (&mut positions,).query_in(arch_id) {
		// ...
	}
}
```

==TODO: Explain why we don't have a `query_all` method/why using it would be an anti-pattern.==

Deletions are handled manually. You must remove all uses of an entity before removing it from its parent archetype. Additionally, there is no way to check whether an `Entity` is still alive at runtime. These limitations exist to avoid creating a global store of entity generations, which would involve locking or flushing of global state. However, you can always write automated deletion mechanisms in userland.

```rust
// Components must be removed from an entity before it can be
// despawned from the archetype lest a UAF warning be raised.
positions.remove(my_zombie);
ai_goals.remove(my_zombie);
zombies.despawn(my_zombie);

// There is no flushing required for spawning or despawning entities.
for (zombie, &pos) in (&positions,).query_in(zombies.id()) {
	unreachable!();  // all our zombies are gone.
}
```

Although there is no way to check whether an `Entity` is still alive at runtime, debug builds will still produce use-after-free (UAF) warnings. This is done using an additional 4-`usize`s worth of metadata in every `Entity` to efficiently check whether the entity is still alive. This adds little runtime overhead but is nonetheless debug-only because of the space overhead.

You can interact with these lifetimes using the `debug::lifetime` module. The most frequently used objects are `Dependent` and the `is_possibly_alive` and `is_condemned` methods from the `LifetimeLike` trait.

```rust
use geode::{Dependent, lifetime::LifetimeLike};

let player_ref = Dependent::new(my_player);

// Uncommenting this section would produce a UAF on player despawn
// because `player_ref` still depends on the `Entity`.
// positions.remove(my_player);
// names.remove(my_player);
// players.despawn(my_player);

drop(player_ref);

// Now that the `player_ref` has been dropped, these run just fine.
positions.remove(my_player);
names.remove(my_player);
players.despawn(my_player);

// You can also check whether the `Entity` has been condemned
// i.e. is guaranteed to be dead. This method will always return
// `false` for debug builds.
let is_condemned = my_player.is_condemned();

// This value is `true` when debug assertions are turned on and
// false if this is a release build.
assert!(is_condemned == cfg!(debug_assertions));
```

==TODO: Document `WeakEntity` and `WeakArchetype` when finalized.==

### Universes

**Universes**, like *worlds* in traditional entity-component-systems, are a store of global state. However, unlike ECS worlds, universes typically only store `Storage`s and `Archetype`sâ€”that's it! It is very rare, although it is allowed, to store global state in the same way that you would store singletons as resources in an ECS world.

We can get away with this in Geode because, unlike a traditional ECS, Geode encourages you to define systems as regular functions receiving their context through their arguments. For example, instead of storing a timer as a resource so that game systems have access to it, the object in charge of handling that scene could pass the entire scene context to its list of dependencies. This ensures that, for example, we can create multiple scenes in a given world without having to replace every instance of a timer resource with a timer component on a scene entity. The mechanisms that make this type of context-passing possible is described in the [providers and context tuples](#providers-and-context-tuples) section.

Although the previous paragraph would suggest that all forms of global state are anti-patterns, encouraging a design where the `Universe` is omitted entirely, we have good reason to put make most `Storages` and some `Archetypes` singletons. ==TODO==

Enough rambling! Here's how to use a `Universe`:
